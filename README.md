# KeinGeld - Open source offline personal finance software

After couple of weeks trying to find a useful software to manage my personal finance. Everything found was costly, complex to use or too much "enterprise".

The __KeinGeld__ keeps your data __offline on your computer__ and contains only the minimal features needed to manage your personal finance. We are not a bank manager, we don't need a powerful dashboard with 100 filtering options and 50 features.

## Features

- Add your expenses and earnings.
  - Transactions per category.

- Overview of your money in a simple _calendar-like_ dashboard.
- Encrypted database.
